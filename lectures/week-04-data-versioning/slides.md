  Lecture for the course "Lifecycle of Artificial Intelligence Systems".
  Covers content-addressed data versioning with DVC, Silo as an S3-compatible
  remote, dvc.yaml pipeline stages and dvc.lock, and linking a data version to an
  MLflow run so the traceability chain reaches the bytes.

# Week 4: Data Versioning

<carbon-data-base class="icon-corner" />

**Lifecycle of Artificial Intelligence Systems**

- What it means to version data, and why Git cannot do it
- DVC: pointers in Git, bytes in object storage
- `dvc.yaml`: the pipeline as a declared graph
- Linking a data version to an MLflow run

<!--
Focus: today the traceability chain from last week reaches the data.
-->

---

# Last week: a record somebody else can check

<Lifecycle stage="design" width="62%" />

- **Tracking:** params, metrics, tags and artifacts for every run
- **Registry:** a named model, immutable versions, movable aliases
- **Traceability:** alias → version → run → params, metrics, `git_commit`

<!--
Focus: one minute. The quiz on the next slides does the real recap.
-->

---
layout: center
---

# **Quiz**
# Which one can change?
# A model version, or an alias?

<div v-click>

**The alias.** A version never changes.

An alias is a name that can move to another version.


</div>

<!--
Focus: immutable history, movable pointers.
Ask: let the room answer before you click.
-->

---
layout: center
---

# **Quiz**
# A run has the best F1 in the sweep.
# Is it ready to deploy?

<div v-click>

**No.** Winning a sweep is not a decision.

Someone must validate and approve the model before it is deployed.

</div>

<!--
Focus: a metric compares runs; a person decides what ships.
Ask: let the room answer before you click.
-->

---
layout: center
---

# **Quiz**
# A run records its `git_commit`.
# Can you rebuild the model from it?

<div v-click>

**Not always.** The code that ran can differ from the commit.

</div>
<div v-click>

> [!TIP]
> A pipeline triggered by the commit runs the training.

</div>
<div v-click>

A model is code **and** data. The commit fixes only the code.

</div>

<!--
Focus: a commit hash is evidence only if the run used exactly that commit. CI pipelines come in Week 7. The last line leads into today's problem.
Ask: let the room answer before you click.
-->

# Recap: Last week's chain stopped at a file path

<carbon-link class="icon-corner" />

```
models:/diabetes-classifier@staging
  -> version 1 -> run 30b3dfb2 -> params, metrics, git_commit
  -> data/diabetes.csv                  <- and here it stopped
```

> [!WARNING]
> The run records the file's **path**, not its **content**.

- Someone edits one row: the path stays the same, the data does not.
- The logged metrics now describe data that no longer exists.
- Nobody can train on the same rows again.

<!--
Focus: this is today's problem. Ask the room: has anyone overwritten a data file and kept the old name?

# 2020: AI to diagnose COVID-19

**The situation.** In early 2020, hospitals needed fast ways to diagnose COVID-19.

- Chest X-rays and CT scans are fast and widely available.
- Many research groups had already trained models to analyse X-rays and CT scans.
- In 2020, they adapted these models to COVID-19.
- Public image datasets appeared within weeks.

**The question:** were any of these models ready for use in hospitals?

<!--
Focus: the task was urgent and reasonable. This is not a story about bad researchers.

# "Frankenstein datasets"

<carbon-copy class="icon-corner" />

The authors named a cause[^1][]:

- public datasets were **built from other public datasets**
- then **republished under a new name**
- until nobody could say what was inside

**What can go wrong when you train and test a model on such datasets?**

<v-click>

> [!WARNING]
> The same images could be in the training data **and** the test data.

</v-click>

[^1]: Roberts et al., *Nature Machine Intelligence* 3, 199–217 (2021).

<!--
Focus: a model is only as checkable as its training data.
Ask: gather two or three answers before the click. Then ask what this does to the test score: it looks better than it really is.
-->

---

# The fix: dataset identity

<carbon-certificate class="icon-corner" />

Requirements today:

- publish **which exact version** of a dataset you used
- document **where the data came from** and how it was put together[^1][]
- keep test data **separate by source**, not only by random split

**Today's goal:** a dataset with versions, and a record of which version trained which model.

# Option B · Face datasets that were withdrawn

<carbon-face-activated class="icon-corner" />

**The situation.** Face recognition research used large public benchmark datasets, such as **MS-Celeb-1M** and **DukeMTMC**.

- Both were **retracted** by their creators.
- A study of these two and a third dataset (LFW) followed nearly **1,000 papers** that cite them[^1][].

**The question:** once a dataset is withdrawn, can anyone say which models still use it?

[^1]: Peng, Mathur and Narayanan, "Mitigating dataset harms requires stewardship: Lessons from 1000 papers", NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks (2021). https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02922

<!--
Option B for the cold open: use it instead of the COVID case (switch `hide` on the four COVID slides).
Focus: withdrawing a dataset does not withdraw the copies.
-->

---
hide: true
---

# Option B · What they missed: copies and derived datasets

<carbon-copy class="icon-corner" />

- **Derived datasets and models** built from them stayed in use after the retraction[^1][].
- **Unclear licences** and **poor dataset management** made it hard to know what was built from what.

**Best practice today:** look after a dataset for its whole life: versions, licence, and a record of what was built from each version.

[^1]: Peng, Mathur and Narayanan, NeurIPS Datasets and Benchmarks (2021). https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02922

<!--
Option B, second slide.
Focus: "which models used this version?" must be a question you can answer.
-->

# Where we are: the data behind the model

<Lifecycle stage="design" width="70%" />

We are still in **development**. Today the **data** gets the same care as the code.

<!--
Focus: we are still in design. Before we build, we must know exactly which data we have.

# 2 · Version data?

# Git already stores every file under its hash.

# Git is really not for data...

<carbon-warning-alt class="icon-corner" />

Git keeps every version of every file, in every clone, for ever.

For code, that is what you want. For data, it hurts:

<v-clicks>

- a 200 MB file committed ten times is 2 GB in **every** clone
- a diff of a binary file tells you nothing
- you cannot delete it later: the history keeps it
- GitHub blocks files larger than 100 MiB[^1][]

</v-clicks>

# THE weather dataset: ERA5

**The industry.** Weather and energy companies use **ERA5**, a record of the past weather for the whole globe, hour by hour, from ECMWF. Studies of wind and solar power output use it[^1][].

**The problem.** For the years **2000–2006**, ERA5 had a **cold bias of about 0.5–1 K** in the lower stratosphere[^2][].

[^1]: Wilczak et al., "Evaluation and Bias Correction of the ERA5 Reanalysis over the United States for Wind and Solar Energy Applications", *Energies* 17(7), 1667 (2024).
[^2]: Simmons et al., "Global stratospheric temperature bias and other stratospheric aspects of ERA5 and ERA5.1", ECMWF Technical Memorandum 859 (Jan 2020).

<!--
Option B for this slot: use it instead of the fraud case (switch `hide` on the three ERA5 slides and the two fraud slides).
Focus: reanalysis = the best estimate of past weather, built from observations and a model. Explain it in one sentence.
-->

---
hide: true
---

# The fix got a new name: ERA5.1

<carbon-version class="icon-corner" />

- ECMWF **re-ran 2000–2006** with a corrected setting and published it as a separate dataset: **ERA5.1**[^1][].
- So "ERA5 for 2003" can mean **two different datasets**.
- A model trained last year and a model trained today may have seen different data, **under the same name**.

> [!TIP]
> Record the provider's exact product and version, and for your own copies, a **content hash**.

[^1]: Simmons et al., ECMWF Technical Memorandum 859 (Jan 2020). https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2020/81149-global-stratospheric-temperature-bias-and-other-stratospheric-aspects-era5-and-era51.pdf

<!--
Option B, second slide.
Focus: a good provider gives the fix a new name. Your own datasets need the same.
Be honest if asked: the bias is high in the atmosphere, so a surface wind model may barely change. The point is being able to say which one you used.
-->

# ERA5 was also fixed in place

<carbon-warning-alt class="icon-corner" />

In 2021, ECMWF found **a few hundred corrupted fields**, out of **3.1 billion**, in two ERA5 hourly datasets on its Climate Data Store[^1][].

<div class="flow">
  <div class="node"><ph-download-simple class="ic" />You download<br>ERA5 files</div>
  <div class="arrow">→</div>
  <div class="node"><ph-wrench class="ic" />Files fixed in place<br><small>14 April and 21 July 2021</small></div>
  <div class="arrow">→</div>
  <div class="node"><ph-files class="ic" />Same name,<br>different bytes</div>
</div>

ECMWF asked users to **re-download** files they got before the fix. Is your copy from before or after?

> [!TIP]
> Record the hash of every file you download. Then you can check your copy at any time.

<!--
Option B, third slide.
Focus: a provider can change the bytes without changing the name. Only your own record of the hash tells you which copy you have.
The corruption showed as a line or band of wrong values across a latitude. The copies in ECMWF's MARS archive were not affected. The page gives no checksums, so users cannot check old downloads.

# Fraud labels arrive weeks later

<carbon-purchase class="icon-corner" />

**The industry.** Card payments. A model scores each transaction and flags possible fraud.

<div class="flow">
  <div class="node" style="width:12rem"><ph-credit-card class="ic" /><b>Day 0</b><br>A payment is made<br><small>label: genuine</small></div>
  <div class="arrow">→</div>
  <div class="node" style="width:12rem"><ph-calendar class="ic" /><b>Days and weeks</b><br>The cardholder reads the statement</div>
  <div class="arrow">→</div>
  <div class="node" style="width:12rem"><ph-warning class="ic" style="color:#dc2626" /><b>A dispute arrives</b><br>The label changes<br><small>label: fraud</small></div>
</div>

**The problem.** A payment counts as genuine unless the cardholder disputes it. Most labels are known only **"after several days (e.g. one month)"**[^1][].

> [!WARNING]
> The **same month** of data has **different labels**, depending on when you copy it.

[^1]: Dal Pozzolo et al., "Credit Card Fraud Detection: A Realistic Modeling and a Novel Learning Strategy", *IEEE Trans. Neural Networks and Learning Systems* 29(8), 3784–3797 (2018). Data: 54.8 million transactions over 296 days.

<!--
Main case for this slot. The hidden ERA5 slides are the alternative.
Focus: "last month's data" is not one dataset. It depends on the day you take it.

# Freeze a snapshot, and record which one

<carbon-camera class="icon-corner" />

You copy **March** twice and retrain each time. Are the two copies the same?

<div v-click>

</div>
</div>

<v-click>

> [!TIP]
> Take a dated snapshot, give it a version, and record its **content hash** with the model.

</v-click>

<!--
Focus: versioning is what turns "last month's data" into one exact dataset. Without the hash, nobody can explain why model A and model B differ.
Ask: let the room answer the question before the first click.
-->

# What is a hash?

<ph-hash class="icon-corner" />

A **hash function** turns any input into a short, fixed-length fingerprint.

<div class="flow">
  <div class="node"><ph-file-csv class="ic" /><span class="mono">6,148,72,35,0,33.<b>6</b>,0.627,50,1</span></div>
  <div class="arrow">→</div>
  <div class="node"><b>md5</b></div>
  <div class="arrow">→</div>
  <div class="node mono">a08191bbcd6221f06a9c23efe7263d38</div>
</div>

<div v-click class="flow">
  <div class="node"><ph-file-csv class="ic" /><span class="mono">6,148,72,35,0,33.<span class="changed">7</span>,0.627,50,1</span></div>
  <div class="arrow">→</div>
  <div class="node"><b>md5</b></div>
  <div class="arrow">→</div>
  <div class="node mono"><span class="changed">094517dc7d352d3d8b39a247ad17134c</span></div>
</div>

<v-clicks>

- The same input always gives the same hash.
- Change one character, and the whole hash changes.
- You cannot rebuild the data from its hash.

</v-clicks>

<!--
Focus: the input is the first patient row of our dataset; the second has BMI 33.7.
Ask: before the click, how much of the hash will change?
If asked: MD5 is not safe against forgery, but fine for noticing a change.
-->

---

# A content hash is computed from the data

<carbon-fingerprint-recognition class="icon-corner" />

```
data/measurements.csv (461 rows)  ->  md5  ->  786c54f2770fa1e7ea5438e6e44b6486
```

- Change one byte and the hash changes.
- Nobody has to remember to rename anything.
- The name **cannot drift** from the data.

> [!NOTE]
> **Content-addressed storage:** each object is stored under a name computed from its content.

<!--
Focus: the identity comes from the content, so "same name" means "same data".
-->

---

# Counter-case: when is this too much?

<carbon-scales class="icon-corner" />

Our dataset is **31,750 bytes**. Git could store it without any problem.

DVC adds costs: a remote, keys, a second `push`, a cache to manage.

- **Worth it:** large data, data that changes, data shared between projects.
- **Too much:** a small file that never changes. Keep it in Git.
- **A public dataset with official versions** (like ERA5.1): record the provider's version.

> [!TIP]
> Whatever you choose, record the **hash** of the data, so you can check your copy later.

<!--
Focus: we use DVC here because the dataset grows (three batches) and to learn the pattern, not because 31 KB needs it.
Ask: does your own project need DVC?
-->

- **Git** keeps a small file that names the data (the hash).
- **An object store** keeps the data itself, under that hash.

You already run an object store: **Silo**, since Week 2.

# Install DVC and start a project

<carbon-terminal class="icon-corner" />

```bash {1|2|3|all}
uv add "dvc[s3]"                  # the [s3] extra adds S3 and S3-compatible stores
dvc init                          # run it inside a Git repository
git commit -m "Initialise DVC"
```

`dvc init` creates a small folder and stages it with `git add`[^1][]:

```
.dvc/
├── .gitignore    keeps the cache out of Git
└── config        settings, such as the remote
.dvcignore        files DVC should not look at
```

> [!TIP]
> In the lab, the DVC project is a subfolder of the course repository, so it uses `dvc init --subdir`.

<!--
Focus: setting up DVC takes one package and one command. The cache folder appears later, on the first `dvc add`.

# `dvc add` writes a pointer file

  size: 19034
  hash: md5
  path: measurements.csv
```

This `measurements.csv.dvc` file goes into Git **instead of** the 19 KB of data.

- `md5`: the hash of the bytes, and their address in storage
- `size`: checked before a download
- `hash`: which algorithm was used
- `path`: relative to this `.dvc` file

<!--
Focus: four fields, about a hundred bytes. Students will read this file on their own disk in Exercise 2.

# `dvc push`: upload data

</div>

- Uploads the files your `.dvc` files point to, from the cache to the remote[^1][].
- Skips files the remote already has: it compares the hashes.
- Run it next to `git push`: Git gets the pointer, the remote gets the data.

  <div class="node" style="width:12rem"><ph-hard-drives class="ic" /><b>Remote</b><br><span class="mono">Silo: dvc-storage</span></div>
</div>

- Downloads the data your `.dvc` files point to, into the cache, then into the workspace.
- It is `dvc fetch` and `dvc checkout` in one command[^1][].
- Use it after `git clone` or `git pull`: Git brings the pointers, `dvc pull` brings the data.

- Makes the workspace match the `.dvc` files, using **only** the local cache[^1][].
- Use it after `git checkout` has moved a pointer to another version.
- It never uses the network.

# Silo now stores two kinds of things

    DVC["dvc CLI"] -->|"S3 API, needs keys"| B2[("bucket: dvc-storage<br/>versioned data")]
```

- MLflow **proxies** artifacts, so your pipeline needs no storage keys.
- DVC talks to Silo **directly**, so it needs keys of its own.

The lab's Makefile passes the Silo keys from `.env` to DVC.

Nothing secret goes into a committed file.

# Going back to version 1

<carbon-time class="icon-corner" />

```bash {1|all}
git checkout HEAD~1 -- data/measurements.csv.dvc   # move the pointer
dvc checkout                                       # move the bytes
```

| | Knows about | Cannot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `git checkout` | commits, pointers, code | put the data on your disk |
| `dvc checkout` | pointers, cache, bytes | tell you which version you want |

**Git chooses the version. DVC delivers it.**

<!--
Focus: after the first command, the pointer and the data on disk disagree. The second command fixes that.

# Storing by hash removes duplicates for free

- Push the same data twice: the second push uploads **nothing**.
- Ten branches with the same dataset store **one** copy.
- Damaged files can be found: hash the bytes again and compare.

# Hyperparameters move from `.env` to `params.yaml`

<carbon-document-tasks class="icon-corner" />

**DVC can only hash files.** A value set in an environment variable is invisible to it.

```yaml
random_seed: 42
prepare:
  test_size: 0.25
train:
  family: logreg
  C: 1.0
```

<br>

> [!NOTE]
> **Rule:** if a value can change the result, it must live in a file the pipeline tracks.

# Pipeline stages

<carbon-flow class="icon-corner" />

```yaml
stages:
  prepare:
    cmd: uv run python src/main.py prepare
    deps:
      - data/measurements.csv
      - src/week_04_dvc_introduction/data.py
    params: [random_seed, prepare.test_size]
    outs:
      - data/processed/train.csv
      - data/processed/test.csv
```

What it **runs** (`cmd`), what it **reads** (`deps`), which **params** it uses, and what it **writes** (`outs`).

Source files are `deps` too. Edit `data.py`, and `prepare` must run again.

<!--
Focus: this is the stage the starter already has. Students write the other two in Exercise 5.
-->

---

# Run the pipeline

<carbon-play class="icon-corner" />

```bash
dvc repro     # run every stage that is out of date, in order
dvc status    # show which deps and outs changed since the last run
dvc dag       # draw the graph of stages
```

How `dvc repro` decides, for each stage:

<div class="flow">
  <div class="node" style="width:11rem"><ph-git-diff class="ic" />Hash the <b>deps</b>,<br>read the <b>params</b></div>

<!--

# **Quiz**

**Nothing.** `touch` changes the file's time, not its content. DVC compares hashes.

</div>

<!--

# `dvc repro` is like `make`, with one big difference

<carbon-repeat class="icon-corner" />

| | `make` | `dvc repro` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Decides by** | file modification **times** | content **hashes** |
| **`touch` a file** | rebuilds everything after it | nothing changes |
| **Restore an old version** | rebuilds | skips: the content is known |
| **Tracks params** | no | yes, by value |

`make` asks "is this newer?". DVC asks "is this **different**?"

<!--
Focus: only the second question is about your data.

# The graph, drawn by `dvc dag`

# `dvc.lock` is the receipt

<carbon-receipt class="icon-corner" />

```yaml

- `dvc.yaml` is your **declared** pipeline: the stages you wrote by hand.
- `dvc.lock` is what **actually ran**: every hash, every parameter value.

> [!TIP]

# 5 · Linking the data to the run

<!--
Focus: DVC knows the data, MLflow knows the run. Now connect them.

---

# Last week's data tracking was **incomplete**

<carbon-tag class="icon-corner" />

```python
mlflow.log_params({"data_path": "diabetes.csv", "n_rows": 768})
```

A file name and a row count.

Both stay the same **when someone edits every value in the file**.

<!--
Focus: this is the Week 3 code students already know. It records where, not what.
-->

---

# Record the data version on the run

<carbon-tag class="icon-corner" />

<div class="flow">
  <div class="node" style="width:18rem"><ph-file-text class="ic" /><b>data/measurements.csv.dvc</b><br><span class="mono">md5: a8fd7b4f…</span></div>

</div>

- The hash is already in the `.dvc` file.
- Log it as a **tag**: tags exist so that someone can **find** a run!

```python
mlflow.set_tags({
    "dvc_md5": dvc_md5,
    "dvc_url": dvc_url,
})
```

- With `git_commit`, the run now names its code **and** its data.

> [!TIP]
> Tag every training run with the data hash, when the run is made.

<!--
Focus: the practice is "every run names the exact data". The tool calls are `mlflow.set_tags` in the lab's `log_data_version` (Exercise 6); do not show the code.
`dvc_url` is where DVC stored those bytes, from `dvc.api.get_url`.
-->

---

# A tag with the hash makes a new question possible

<carbon-search class="icon-corner" />

Every run now carries `dvc_md5`. Tags are searchable, so you can now ask:

```python
mlflow.search_runs(filter_string="tags.dvc_md5 = 'a8fd7b4f…'")
```

Not "which run scored best?" but **"which runs ever trained on this data?"**

<!--
Focus: students write the tagging code in Exercise 6. Do not show it here.
-->

# MLflow can log datasets too

<carbon-data-set class="icon-corner" />

MLflow has its own dataset API: `mlflow.data.from_pandas` and `mlflow.log_input`[^1][].

<div class="text-sm">

| It records | Example from our run |
| --- | --- |
| name and **context** | `diabetes-measurements`, `training` |
| **source**: where the data is | `s3://dvc-storage/…` |

| **digest**: its own hash | `9a465ecc` |
| **search** by it | `dataset.digest = '9a465ecc'` |

`dvc import-db` takes the snapshot and keeps the query, so it can repeat it[^1][]:

```bash
dvc import-db --sql "SELECT * FROM patients" --conn warehouse -o data/patients.csv
dvc update data/patients.csv.dvc      # run the query again, get a new version
```

> [!TIP]
> If the tables themselves need history, use a tool built for tables: Delta Lake, Dolt or lakeFS.

[^1]: DVC docs, "import-db". https://doc.dvc.org/command-reference/import-db

<!--
Focus: the practice is "snapshot, then version the snapshot". `dvc import-db` does both in one step.
The connection `warehouse` must be set up in the DVC config first; see the docs.

# Data versioning strategies

<carbon-tool-box class="icon-corner" />

<div class="text-sm">

| **Data type** | **DVC** | **Consider** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| a few files | `dvc add` | Git, if small and never changing |
| a folder of images or audio | `dvc add <folder>` | lakeFS, for tens of thousands of files |
| a database table | `dvc import-db`: a snapshot | Delta Lake, Dolt |
| a file in someone else's bucket | `dvc import-url`: tracks it, and `dvc update` checks for changes[^1][] | |
| data in another DVC repository | `dvc import`: records the repository and the version[^2][] | |

</div>

[^1]: DVC docs, "import-url". https://doc.dvc.org/command-reference/import-url
[^2]: DVC docs, "import". https://doc.dvc.org/command-reference/import

<!--
Focus: the practice is the same for every row: give the data a fixed version and record it with the model. Only the tool changes.
Ask: which row is your project?

# Traps you will meet in the lab

<carbon-debug class="icon-corner" />

| Trap | What you see | What is wrong |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `dvc init` in a subfolder | "not tracked by any supported SCM tool" | Our labs live inside a bigger Git repo: use `--subdir` |
| `dvc push` by hand | `NoCredentialsError` | DVC needs the Silo keys; the Makefile passes them |
| `dvc checkout` | "Checkout failed" | That version is not in your cache: `dvc pull` |
| `dvc repro` after no change | "didn't change, skipping" | Correct! Use `make link` to force one stage |
| A file nobody changed | `dvc status`: modified | Windows line endings (CRLF): DVC 3 hashes raw bytes |

<!--
Hidden: lab-specific. Show it at the start of the lab session instead.
Focus: the last row is the hardest to diagnose remotely. The lab protects against it twice.

# Byte-exact means byte-exact

<carbon-data-check class="icon-corner" />

The same CSV, checked out on two laptops:

```
glucose,outcome\r\n    (Windows, CRLF)  ->  one md5
glucose,outcome\n      (macOS, LF)      ->  a different md5
```

Same rows, same columns, **different bytes**, so a different version.

> [!TIP]
> Fix the line endings of data files in `.gitattributes` (`*.csv text eol=lf`), and write data files with `\n` in your code.

<!--
Focus: a content hash answers an exact question. Make sure it is the question you meant.

# Automate commands that must run together

<carbon-unlink class="icon-corner" />

A teammate commits the new `.dvc` file and runs `git push`, but forgets `dvc push`.

<div class="flow">
  <div class="node no-shrink" style="width:13rem"><carbon-logo-git class="ic" style="color:#f05032" /><b>Git</b><br><small>the new pointer:<br>the hash of version 3</small></div>
  <div class="arrow-l fail">no file with this hash<span class="arrow">✗</span></div>
  <div class="node no-shrink" style="width:13rem"><ph-hard-drives class="ic" /><b>Remote</b><br><small>versions 1 and 2 only</small></div>
</div>

It works on their laptop, from their cache. On yours, `dvc pull` fails.

> [!TIP]
> Run `dvc install` once per clone. Its Git `pre-push` hook runs `dvc push` before every `git push`[^1][].

[^1]: DVC docs, "install". https://doc.dvc.org/command-reference/install

<!--
Focus: the most common team error with DVC. The hook makes the right order automatic.
`dvc install` also adds a post-checkout hook (runs `dvc checkout`) and a pre-commit hook (runs `dvc status`).
-->

---

# Storage keys in a committed file

<carbon-password class="icon-corner" />

`.dvc/config` is committed to Git.

A remote key written there is shared with everyone who can read the repository, and it stays in the history.

`dvc remote modify myremote secret_access_key …` puts the key **into that file**.

> [!TIP]
> Add `--local`: the key goes to `.dvc/config.local`, which Git ignores[^1][]. Or pass the keys as environment variables.

[^1]: DVC docs, "remote modify". https://doc.dvc.org/command-reference/remote/modify

<!--
Focus: the same rule as Week 2's `.env`: settings in Git, secrets out of it. The lab's Makefile passes the Silo keys as environment variables.
Ask: how would you remove a key that is already in Git history? (You cannot, easily: rotate the key.)
-->

# Training on data you have not added

<carbon-warning-alt class="icon-corner" />

You fix a few rows in `data/measurements.csv` and train at once, before `dvc add`.

The run's `dvc_md5` tag comes from the `.dvc` file, so it names the **old** data.

<br>

```text
$ dvc status
data/measurements.csv.dvc:
	changed outs:
		modified:           data/measurements.csv
```

<br>

> [!TIP]
> Before a run you want to keep, `dvc status` must say "Data and pipelines are up to date." If not, run `dvc add` and commit first.

<!--
Focus: a data hash is evidence only if the data on disk is the data it names. The same lesson as Week 3's commit hash.
The output format is from dvc 3.67.1.

# Worth a look: 15,841 cases that nobody saw

<carbon-idea class="icon-corner" />

**UK, autumn 2020.** Public Health England collected positive COVID-19 test results in files.

- Some files were **too large** for the system that loaded them[^1][].
- **15,841 positive cases** (25 Sept – 2 Oct) were not passed on to contact tracing in time.
- Reports blamed an old Excel format, which holds at most 65,536 rows per sheet[^2][].

<br>

> [!TIP]
> A file that looks fine can still be incomplete. Compare the row count with the source before you version the file.

# Option B · Worth a look: five countries left out

<carbon-chart-bar class="icon-corner" />

**Economics, 2010.** A famous paper said that countries with public debt above 90% of GDP grew at **−0.1%** per year on average.

**2013.** A student, Thomas Herndon, tried to reproduce it. A spreadsheet error had left out **Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada and Denmark**. With the errors fixed, the average was **2.2%**[^1][].

> [!TIP]
> The error was found only because the spreadsheet was shared. Publish the exact data, and a list of the rows that went in.

Option B for "worth a look": use it instead of the PHE case.
Focus: a replication found the error because the exact data could be checked.

# 8 · Wrap-up

<!--
Focus: the takeaways, what is still open, the lab and next week. The lecture ends with the discussion and the questions students can now answer.
-->

---

# Key takeaways

<carbon-list-checked class="icon-corner" />

- **A model is code and data.** Without the exact data version, a metric describes nothing anyone can check.
- **Name data by its content.** A hash changes when the bytes change; a path or a date does not.
- **Keep the pointer in Git and the bytes in an object store.** One commit then fixes the code and the data together.
- **Record the data version on every run.** Then "which models used this data?" is one query.
- **Sometimes it is a legal duty.** A regulator can order you to delete models built from certain data, and the EU AI Act asks where training data came from.
- **The practice outlives the tool.** DVC here; lakeFS, Git LFS or Delta Lake in your next team.

<!--
Focus: the general lessons, not the commands. Return to the COVID case: this is the record those papers lacked.

# What this week does not solve

</div>

<!--
Focus: each open question and the week that answers it.
If asked "do we still need dvc.yaml once Prefect arrives?": yes. `dvc repro` decides WHAT is out of date, by content; Prefect decides WHEN it runs, how often, and what happens on failure. In Week 8 the flow calls `dvc repro` as one task.
-->

# This week's lab

| # | Exercise | What you show |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Initialise DVC, point it at Silo | the remote is configured, with no keys in Git |
| 2 | Version 1: add, read the pointer, push | four lines in Git, the bytes in Silo |
| 3 | The round trip | `checkout` fails with an empty cache; `pull` restores the data |
| 4 | New batches and time travel | three versions, and you can go back to version 1 |
| 5 | Declare the pipeline | `dvc repro` re-runs only what a change affects |
| 6 | Link the run to the data | runs can be found by the data they used |
| 7 | Catch data you have not added (optional) | a run cannot name data that is not on disk |

The Compose stack is Week 3's, plus one more Silo bucket.

<!--
Focus: stop the Week 3 stack before the lab; both use the same ports.

# Next week: Data Quality

<carbon-data-check class="icon-corner" />

You can now prove **which** bytes trained a model.

Nothing has checked whether those bytes were **any good**.

The data still has patients with a **glucose of 0** and a **BMI of 0**. Both are impossible. Today we gave them a permanent, versioned identity.

Week 5: **data contracts** and **validation** with Pandera, before the data reaches training.

<!--
Focus: end on the impossible zeros. Students have seen them since Week 1.
-->
---

# Discussion

<carbon-forum class="icon-corner" />

1. **Fraud labels keep changing for weeks.** Would you version the data every day, once a month, or at every training run? What does each choice cost?
2. **You can prove which bytes trained a model.** Does that make the model trustworthy?
3. **A patient withdraws consent.** What must your storage look like for deletion to be possible at all?

<!--
Focus: five minutes in pairs. Question 2 leads into Week 5 (the impossible zeros are still in the data).
-->

---

# After this lecture, you can answer

<carbon-education class="icon-corner" />

- Why is Git the wrong tool for data?
- What does a `.dvc` file contain, and where do the bytes live?
- How do you move between two versions of a dataset?
- Which stages will `dvc repro` re-run after a change?
- How do you link a data version to an MLflow run?

<!--
Focus: let the room answer one or two. The lab checks each one.
