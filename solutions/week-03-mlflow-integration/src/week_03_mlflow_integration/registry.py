"""The model registry: versions, aliases, governance tags, and traceability.

New in Week 3. Tracking answers "which run scored best?". It cannot answer
"what are we serving?" — for that you need a NAME, a stable address, an approval
record, and a rollback target. That is the registry.

Four nouns:
  registered model  a name, e.g. "diabetes-classifier"
  version           an immutable, numbered snapshot of one run's model
  alias             a MUTABLE pointer to exactly one version: models:/<name>@staging
  tag               a recorded fact attached to a version (who promoted it, on what)

Note what is absent: model *stages*. MLflow deprecated the fixed
None/Staging/Production/Archived state machine in 2.9 and the official registry
tutorial now uses aliases exclusively. See the lab README for the one-line
deviation note, and the lecture for why the change was an improvement.
